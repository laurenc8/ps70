                    This week, we learned how to operate the laser cutter and the vinyl cutter, as well as how to make basic
                    designs in Fusion 360 and Inkscape.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Box

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    The first assignment was to make a shoe-sized box to hold our materials for the rest of the semester.
                    Based on the tutorial in class, I decided to make a finger joint box.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    The process involved first sketching the design in Fusion 360, exporting it as a DXF, cleaning the file up
                    in Rhino, and then using the laser cutter to cut it out of a sheet of cardboard. My initial set of parameters
                    in Fusion 360 included: length, width, height, thickness, and num_fingers. My first attempt looked like this:

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    As expected, the pieces didn't fit together perfectly on the first try. After talking to Bobby, we concluded
                    that there were two major things to fix. First, I needed to make the scoring lines deeper because the
                    creases were a bit stiff. Second, I had to make the fingers larger (both longer and wider); if they are too
                    small, they won't catch. As seen in the right picture, the tiny fingers didn't fit really well and weren't
                    strong enough to hold the walls together.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    After fixing those two things, I printed a second box. This version was better; it was just the fingers that
                    were a bit too loose. Even though they fit into each other, they wouldn't stay together by themselves. (If 
                    you look really closely at the picture on the right, you can see a very thin gap between the fingers.) This
                    is likely due to kerf, the material that is removed when the laser burns through the cardboard; this amount
                    changes based on the material youâ€™re cutting (denser material = larger kerf because the laser is burning away
                    longer). To fix this, I added a parameter to the Fusion 360 design for kerf, and set it to 0.5 mm. I also
                    decided to increase all the other dimension parameters too since box v2 was a little small.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Everything finally stayed together! I think the kerf could have been slightly smaller, maybe 0.4 mm,
                    because the fingers were a bit tight. Luckily, cardboard is squishy enough for me to wiggle them in.

                    The second assignment was to use a vector graphics tool to create a monochromatic design, and cut something
                    with the vinyl cutter. I decided to make a Pusheen sticker for my little sister because she loves sending me
                    Pusheen gifs. I found an image of Pusheen online and imported it to Inkscape. There, I converted it to a
                    vector image using the Trace Bitmap feature. I then printed it using the vinyl cutter, took away the
                    negative area, and applied the transfer paper on top.
