                    This week, we learned how to operate the laser cutter and the vinyl cutter, as well as how to make basic
                    designs in Fusion 360 and Inkscape.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    The first assignment was to make a shoe-sized box to hold our materials for the rest of the semester.
                    Based on the tutorial in class, I decided to make a finger joint box.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    My first attempt looked like this:
                </p>

                <div class="image-row">

                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./box_v1.jpeg" alt="box v1" width="400">
                        <figcaption>Box v1</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./box_v1_fingers.jpeg" alt="box v1's fingers" width="250">
                        <figcaption>Box v1's fingers</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    As expected, the pieces didn't fit together perfectly on the first try. After talking to Bobby, we concluded
                    that there were two major things to fix. First, I needed to make the scoring lines deeper because the
                    creases were a bit stiff. Second, I had to make the fingers larger (both longer and wider); if they are too
                    small, they won't catch very well. As seen in the right picture, the tiny fingers didn't fit really well and
                    weren't strong enough to hold the walls together without falling apart.
