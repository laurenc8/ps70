                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Started in the late 1970s, Micromouse is a competition robotic mice race to solve a 16x16 maze. Each square
                    cell has side length 180 mm with walls 50 mm high. The mouse needs to map out the maze, find the best path,
                    and go from one of the four corners to the center of the maze.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    I would like to develop my own micromouse! Making the robot autonomously learn the maze will involve
                    concepts from robotics, including mapping, planning, and localization. Once it knows what the maze looks
                    like, it will use a search algorithm to find the optimal path. I think the hardest part may be making the
                    robot small enough, so I will likely loosen those constraints. I will likely have a smaller grid (say 5x5)
                    with bigger cells (say side length 10cm) than in the real competitions.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Besides the mouse itself, I will make a board with pieces for the walls that one can insert to make custom
                    mazes. This will allow me to test different maze designs of varying difficulty!

                    microcontroller and the batteries. My 3D model is in progress!

                    Replacing the Hardware Components
                </h3>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    After making the MVP, the first major issue I noticed was that the motors were not powerful enough to move the
                    robot, so I switched to a more powerful DC motor. The hole in the smaller wheels only fit the old motors, so I
                    also had to replace them with larger wheels. To connect the motor and the wheel, I had to 3D print a small piece that
                    would pressfit in the motor shaft on one side and the hole in the wheel on the other side since the shapes were no
                    longer a precise match. Getting the dimensions right took many many tries... This piece would also break occasionally
                    if there was too much pressure applied to it when trying to push in the pressfit, so I also increased the infill
                    from 15% to 30% to make it stronger.
                </p>

                <div class="image-row">

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    I added a caster wheel in the front that was mainly to help micromouse balance, like a tricycle. Otherwise, the base would
                    often tip forwards or backwards. I also 3D printed a connector piece to replace the cardboard one in the MVP and recut the
                    base out of wood instead of cardboard to be more sturdy.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    The second issue was that the motor itself would rotate sometimes, rather than just the motor shaft rotating.
                    I first noticed this when the wires kept getting twisted around the motor. To fix this, I added 2 holes in the
                    connector piece for M2.5 screws to hold the motor in place. This also took a few tries to get the position right, but
                    it was very successful in fixing the issue!
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    I noticed that the motors were dipping because there was nothing supporting them. Although they were not touching
                    the ground, this tilted the wheels at a slight angle so that they were no longer perfectly perpendicular to the ground, which
                    wasn't causing big problems but also wasn't ideal. I decided to reprint the connector piece with a third side that would lay
                    under the motor to help support it. Unfortunately, I made the height a little too tall, but it does prevent it from dipping too
                    drastically.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    For the final assembly, I stuck the breadboard to the base with some tape, screwed the L9110's into the holes on the
                    side so that they were no longer floating, and clipped the wires to the right size / used zipties to reduce clutter.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Finally, it was time to code! After lots of debugging, we had gotten the ultrasonic sensor to work with the
                    ESP32 Xiao (see <a href="../09_networking/index.html">Week 9</a>). Part of the issue was finding the right pair of
                    pins to use for Trig and Echo; for some reason, D9 and D2 worked but all the other pairs we tried did not. I tried
                    to find two more pairs of pins for the side ultrasonic sensors on our micromouse, but to no avail. So, I decided to
                    stick with just a front sensor and utilize turning to explore the maze.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    When first testing the motors, I occasionally encountered a bug where the serial monitor would rapidly disconnect and reconnect.
                    After searching Google and talking to Bobby, we concluded that this was happening because the USB power supply from my computer was not sufficient for
                    the motors, and one possible solution was using a LiPo battery instead. However, the issue eventually stopped occurring
                    so I continued using the USB power supply for now.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    At this point, micromouse was able to go straight until it sensed a wall, and then stop. The next major step
                    was a 90 degree turn. To turn left, I stopped the left wheel and only turned the right wheel. I first tried
                    to use a counter in the <code>loop</code> function to measure how much it had turned, but I quickly realized
                    that the time for each loop iteration was not constant and fluctuated quite a bit. I instead used <code>millis</code>
                    to time how long a 90 degree turn would take. This was better, but also proved to be a little irregular.
