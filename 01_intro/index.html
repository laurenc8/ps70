                </h3>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Started in the late 1970s, Micromouse is a competition robotic mice race to solve a 16x16 maze. Each square
                    cell has side length 180 mm with walls 50 mm high. The mouse needs to map out the maze, find the best path,
                    and go from one of the four corners to the center of the maze.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    I would like to develop my own micromouse! Making the robot autonomously learn the maze will involve
                    concepts from robotics, including mapping, planning, and localization. Once it knows what the maze looks
                    like, it will use a search algorithm to find the optimal path. I think the hardest part may be making the
                    robot small enough, so I will likely loosen those constraints. I will likely have a smaller grid (say 5x5)
                    with bigger cells (say side length 10cm) than in the real competitions.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Besides the mouse itself, I will make a board with pieces for the walls that one can insert to make custom
                    mazes. This will allow me to test different maze designs of varying difficulty!

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    My general idea for the robot is to have two layers. The first layer holds the breadboard, the sensors (one
                    on the left, right, and front) and the motors that are connected to the wheels. The second layer holds the
                    microcontroller and the batteries. My 3D model is in progress!
