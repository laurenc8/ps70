                    This week, we learned how to 3D print using the MK3S+ model printer and Prusa Slicer software, as well as
                    how to scan objects using the Revopoint scanner.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    The first assignment was to design and print a small object that could not be easily made by subtractive
                    methods. Inspired by my geometry class, I decided to print a m√∂bius strip, which is a surface with one side
                    and one edge! It can be formed by attaching the ends of a strip of paper together with a half-twist. I
                    followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/c-ifxjfseBQ">tutorial</span></a> to create the design in Fusion 360.
                    I then exported the design to Prusa Slicer. Before printing, I had to add supports everywhere because the
                    mobius strip is so curved and there was very little surface area in contact with the print bed. The final
                    design took 2 hrs 55 min to print. After printing, I used a paint scraper to gently remove the supporting
                    filament.
